Some top-line exploration
```{r}
##Which candidates are in this batch of data?
ad_spending %>%
  group_by(candidate_name) %>%
  count()

##How much did candidates get supported and opposed?
ad_spending %>%
  group_by(candidate_name, support_oppose_indicator) %>%
  count()

##How much did leadership spend opposing Cisneros?

cisneros_oppose <- ad_spending %>%
  filter(candidate_name == "CISNEROS, JESSICA") %>%
  filter(support_oppose_indicator == "O")
```
